# Eclipse 4 Developer Course
Courses aimed at developers using the Eclipse 4 platform to develop Rich Client Applications.

This was the output of my frustrations trying to find a consolidated place to explain how to leverage the seemingly powerful Eclipse 4 platform to *actually* create productive applications instead of spending all the time searching how-to's. Many thanks to other resources online like:

- [vogella.com](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/eclipse.html)
- [eclipsesource.com](https://eclipsesource.com/tutorial-downloads/Eclipse_4_Tutorial.pdf)
- [eclipse-tycho](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/tree/main)

My goal is to create the resource I want to have as I progress on this journey to learn Eclipse 4. Good luck to all who attempt to follow! ðŸ™‚

Before getting started, I **highly** suggest reading the excellent [Getting Started with Eclipse RCP](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseRCP/article.html) to get a basic overview of the overall Eclipse programming model as well as getting your development environment setup.
